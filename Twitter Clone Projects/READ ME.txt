The project is a simply prepared twitter website. The project provides login with our own user name and
password. We can also add or edit our own tweets and see other people's tweets. The project was made using
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), ReactJS, Redux library and Firebase database. Encodings were done via Visual
Studio Code.
